INTRODUCTION                                                 *syncopate-intro*

Syncopate makes it very easy to share beautiful code in webmail windows,
Google Docs, etc.

Use the |:SyncopateExportToBrowser| command to open a new browser tab with
your buffer's contents, syntax highlighting and all.  (If you're in
|visual-mode|, only the selected text will be exported.)  Then you can
copy-paste from the browser tab into your intended destination.

Use a keymapping for even more convenience (see |syncopate:plugin[mappings]|).
The default mapping is "<Leader><>".  So if your |<Leader>| is set to ",",
then the mapping ",<>" will run |:SyncopateExportToBrowser| for you.
(Mnemonic: "<>" is reminiscent of HTML tags, and it triggers HTML output.)

Syncopate will automatically switch to the default colorscheme before output,
since this tends to show up better (and be less error-prone!) on white
backgrounds.  You can change this behaviour with the
|syncopate:change_colorscheme| and |syncopate:colorscheme| settings.  In any
case, Syncopate restores your original colorscheme once it's finished.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURING WITH STANDARD SETTINGS                 *syncopate-standard-config*

Syncopate is based on the built-in |convert-to-HTML| functionality, which
already has a wealth of configurable settings.  We try to use these settings
wherever possible.  (For additional, Syncopate-specific settings, see
|syncopate-config|.)

For example: many people who use line numbers in vim do not want them in the
HTML output, since they would show up when recipients copy-paste the code into
an editor window.  By default, HTML output includes line numbers whenever vim
does.  To force them not to appear, use the |g:html_number_lines| setting: add
>
  let g:html_number_lines = 0
<
to your vimrc.

To browse all available settings, go to the first one (|g:html_diff_one_file|)
and scroll down from there.

CONFIGURATION                                               *syncopate-config*

This plugin uses maktaba flags for configuration. Install Glaive
(https://github.com/google/glaive) and use the |:Glaive| command to configure
them.

                                                *syncopate:change_colorscheme*
Use a different colorscheme for the HTML output.  This can make the text more
readable.
Default: 1 `

                                                       *syncopate:colorscheme*
The colorscheme to switch to for the HTML output.  The default is "default",
since it shows up nicely on a white background (as in most webmail windows).

This setting has no effect if |syncopate:change_colorscheme| is false.
Default: 'default' `

                                                           *syncopate:browser*
The browser command which |:SyncopateExportToBrowser| will use.

The default, "sensible-browser", only works on Debian-based systems (including
Ubuntu).  It can be configured by the "update-alternatives" command.  If you
don't want to do this (or if you're not using a Debian-based system), you will
need to set this flag for the browser export to work.
Default: 'sensible-browser' `

                                                          *syncopate:clear_bg*
Controls whether |:SyncopateExportToClipboard| will clear the background
colour.

This can be useful for copy-pasting into a destination (e.g., some talk
slides) whose background colour might be slightly different than the
background in the editor.
Default: 0 `

                                                  *syncopate:plugin[commands]*
Configures whether plugin/commands.vim should be loaded.
Default: 1 `

                                                  *syncopate:plugin[mappings]*
Configures whether plugin/mappings.vim should be loaded.
Default: 0 `

COMMANDS                                                  *syncopate-commands*

:[range]SyncopateExportToBrowser                   *:SyncopateExportToBrowser*
  Export syntax-highlighted text, in HTML format, to a browser tab.

:[range]SyncopateExportToClipboard               *:SyncopateExportToClipboard*
  Export syntax-highlighted text, in HTML format, to the clipboard. Requires
  xclip to be installed on your system.

==============================================================================
FUNCTIONS                                                *syncopate-functions*

syncopate#ClipboardOperatorfunc({type})    *syncopate#ClipboardOperatorfunc()*
  An operator function to integrate with text objects.

  We ignore the {type}, since 2html.vim only seems to work linewise.
